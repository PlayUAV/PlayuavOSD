@par Description

Binary images of the user program
=================================
This folder contains the following images that can be loaded and executed by the 
FW upgrade application:  
    - STM32F4-Discovery_Demo_0x08008000.bin
    - STM32F4-Discovery_MEMS_0x08008000.bin
    - STM32F4-Discovery_SysTick_0x08008000.bin

You have to load these binaries to the root directory of a USB key, then rename 
the binary to be executed to "image.bin".


Binary images of the FW upgrade application
===========================================
This directory contains binary files (*.hex and *.dfu) that can be used with the
STM32F4xx’s embedded Bootloader or any in-system programming tool
to reprogram this application into the Internal Flash memory, as described below:  
 + Using "in-system programming tool"
    - Connect the STM32F4-Discovery board to a PC with a 'USB type A to Mini-B'
      cable through USB connector CN1 to power the board.
    - Make sure that the embedded ST-LINK/V2 is configured for in-system programming
      (both CN3 jumpers ON)
    - Use "STM32F4-Discovery_FW_Upgrade_V1.0.0.hex" binary with your preferred 
      in-system programming tool to reprogram the demonstration firmware 
      (ex. STM32 ST-LINK Utility, available for download from www.st.com).
 
 + Using "Bootloader (USB FS Device in DFU mode)"
    - Configure the STM32F4-Discovery board to boot from "System Memory" (boot pins BOOT0:1 / BOOT1:0)
        - Set BOOT0 pin to high level: on the male header P2 place a jumper between
          BOOT0 pin and VDD pin 
        - Set BOOT1(PB2) pin to low level: on the male header P1 place a jumper
          between PB2 pin and GND pin        
    - Connect a 'USB type A to Mini-B' cable between PC and USB connector CN1
      to power the board.
    - Connect a 'USB type A to Micro-B' cable between PC and USB connector CN5,
      the board will be detected as USB device.
    - Use "STM32F4-Discovery_FW_Upgrade_V1.0.0.dfu" binary with "DFUse\DFUse Demonstration"
      tool (available for download from www.st.com) to reprogram the demonstration firmware 

For more information, please refer to the document "Upgrading STM32F4DISCOVERY board
 firmware using a USB key (AN3990)" available on www.st.com/stm32f4-discovery.
