@par Description

This directory contains binary files (*.hex and *.dfu) of the "Audio playback and
recording using the STM32F4DISCOVERY" application. 

You can use the STM32F4xx’s embedded Bootloader or any in-system programming tool
to reprogram this application using these binary files, as described below:

 + Using "in-system programming tool"
    - Connect the STM32F4-Discovery board to a PC with a 'USB type A to Mini-B'
      cable through USB connector CN1 to power the board.
    - Make sure that the embedded ST-LINK/V2 is configured for in-system programming
      (both CN3 jumpers ON)
    - Use "STM32F4-Discovery_Audio_USB_V1.0.0.hex" or "STM32F4-Discovery_Audio_IntFLASH_V1.0.0.hex"
      binary with your preferred in-system programming tool to reprogram the demonstration firmware 
      (ex. STM32 ST-LINK Utility, available for download from www.st.com).
 
 + Using "Bootloader (USB FS Device in DFU mode)"
    - Configure the STM32F4-Discovery board to boot from "System Memory" (boot pins BOOT0:1 / BOOT1:0)
        - Set BOOT0 pin to high level: on the male header P2 place a jumper between
          BOOT0 pin and VDD pin 
        - Set BOOT1(PB2) pin to low level: on the male header P1 place a jumper
          between PB2 pin and GND pin        
    - Connect a 'USB type A to Mini-B' cable between PC and USB connector CN1
      to power the board.
    - Connect a 'USB type A to Micro-B' cable between PC and USB connector CN5,
      the board will be detected as USB device.
    - Use "STM32F4-Discovery_Audio_USB_V1.0.0.dfu" or "STM32F4-Discovery_Audio_IntFLASH_V1.0.0.dfu" 
      binary with "DFUse\DFUse Demonstration" tool (available for download from www.st.com) to reprogram
      the demonstration firmware 

For more information, please refer to the document "Audio playback and recording using
 the STM32F4DISCOVERY (AN3997)" available on www.st.com/stm32f4-discovery.
