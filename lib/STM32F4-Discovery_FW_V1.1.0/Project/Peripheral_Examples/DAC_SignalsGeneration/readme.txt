@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the DAC peripheral to 
generate several signals using DMA controller.
When the user presses the USER push-button, DMA transfers the two selected 
waveforms to the DAC.
For each press on USER button, 2 signals has been selected and can be monitored on  
the two DAC channels:
    - Escalator waveform (Channel 1) and Sine waveForm (Channel 2).
    - Noise waveform (Channel 1) and Triangle waveform (Channel 2).

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F4xx Devices Revision A.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM32F4-Discovery (MB997) RevA and can be
    easily tailored to any other development board.

  - STM32F4-Discovery 	
     - Use USER push-button connected to PA.00.
     - Connect PA4 (DAC Channel1) and PA5 (DAC Channel2) pins to an oscilloscope.
