@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC3 and DMA to transfer continuously 
converted data from ADC3 to memory.
The ADC3 is configured to convert continuously channel7.
Each time an end of conversion occurs the DMA transfers, in circular mode, the
converted data from ADC3 DR register to the ADC3ConvertedValue variable.

In this example, the system clock is 144MHz, APB2 = 72MHz and ADC clock = APB2/2. 
Since ADC3 clock is 36 MHz and sampling time is set to 3 cycles, the conversion 
time to 12bit data is 12 cycles so the total conversion time is (12+3)/36= 0.41us(2.4Msps).

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F4xx Devices Revision A.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM32F4-Discovery (MB997) RevA and can be
    easily tailored to any other development board.
    
  - STM32F4-Discovery 
    - Connect the external signal(ranges from 0 to 3.3V) to the ADC3 pin (PC.02) to be converted.
