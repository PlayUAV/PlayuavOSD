@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to enable and disable the write protection
for the STM32F4xx FLASH.

By maintaining the User push-button pressed at Reset, the program will check the 
write protection status of FLASH_WRP_SECTORS (defined in main.c) 
  - If FLASH_WRP_SECTORS are write protected, the write protection will be disabled.
    Then LED4 will turn ON, if the protection disable operation is done correctly,
    otherwise LED5 turns ON.
  - If FLASH_WRP_SECTORS are not write protected, the write protection will be enabled.
    Then LED6 will turn ON, if the protection enable operation is done correctly,
    otherwise LED5 turns ON.

If after reset the User push-button is not pressed, the program will simply turn ON LED3.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F4xx Devices Revision A.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM32F4-Discovery (MB997) RevA and can be
    easily tailored to any other development board

  - STM32F4-Discovery  
    - Use LED4, LED3, LED5 and LED6 connected respectively to PD.12, PD.13, PD.14
      and PD.15 pins
    - Use the User push-button connected to pin PA0 (EXTI Line0)
