@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure external interrupt lines.
In this example, the EXTI Line0 (connected to PA0 pin) is configured  to generate
an interrupt on each rising edge. In the interrupt routine a led connected to
PD.12 pin is toggled.

@note In this example, EXTILine0_Config() function can be substituted by 
      STM_EVAL_PBInit(Button_USER, Mode_EXTI) provided in the STM32F4-Discovery driver.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F4xx Devices Revision A.

  - This example has been tested with STM32F4-Discovery (MB997) RevA and can be
    easily tailored to any other development board.

  - STM32F4-Discovery  
    - Use the User push-button connected to pin PA0 (EXTI Line0)
