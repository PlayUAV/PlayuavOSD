@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the MEMS accelerometre to detect acceleration on X/Y axis
and to detect the click/double click on Z axis.

After startup the program checks the MEMS accelerometre status registers and behaves as follows:
  1. If the board is moved the acceleration is detected on x/Y axis and LEDs toggles according to
     the motion direction and speed.

  2. If a click is detected on Z axis LED3 and LED6 toggles during 3s. 

  3. If a double click is detected on Z axis all LEDs toggles during 3s. 

Note: The LEDs lighting is managed by TIM4 capture compare channels

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F4xx Devices Revision A.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM32F4-Discovery (MB997) RevA and can be
    easily tailored to any other development board

  - STM32F4-Discovery
    - Use MEMS accelerometre LIS302DL (U5)
