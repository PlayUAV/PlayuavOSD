@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the SysTick to generate a time base equal to
1 ms. The system clock is set to 168 MHz, the SysTick is clocked by the AHB clock
(HCLK).

A "Delay" function is implemented based on the SysTick end-of-count event.
Four LEDs are toggled with a timing defined by the Delay function.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F4xx Devices Revision A.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM32F4-Discovery (MB997) RevA and can be
    easily tailored to any other development board

  - STM32F4-Discovery
    - LED4, LED3, LED5 and LED6 are connected respectively to PD.12, PD.13, PD.14
      and PD.15 pins
