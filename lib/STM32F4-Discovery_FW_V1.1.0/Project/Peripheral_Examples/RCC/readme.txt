@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use, for debug purpose, the RCC_GetClocksFreq function 
to retrieve the current status and frequencies of different on chip clocks. 
You can see the RCC_ClockFreq structure content, which hold the frequencies of 
different on chip clocks, using your toolchain debugger.

This example handles also the High Speed External clock (HSE) failure detection:
when the HSE clock disappears (broken or disconnected external Quartz); HSE, PLL
are disabled (but no change on PLL config), HSI selected as system clock source
and an interrupt (NMI) is generated. In the NMI ISR, the HSE, HSE ready interrupt
are enabled and once HSE clock recover, the HSERDY interrupt is generated and in
the RCC ISR routine the system clock is reconfigured to its previous state (before
HSE clock failure). You can monitor the system clock on MCO2 pin(PC9).

Four LEDs are toggled with a timing defined by the Delay function.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F4xx Devices Revision A.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM32F4-Discovery (MB997) RevA and can be
    easily tailored to any other development board

  - STM32F4-Discovery
    - LED4, LED3, LED5 and LED6 connected respectively to PD.12, PD.13, PD.14
      and PD.15 pins.
    - Connect the PC9 pin to an oscilloscope to monitor the system clock frequency.
