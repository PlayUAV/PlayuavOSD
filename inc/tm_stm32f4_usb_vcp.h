 * Version 1.1
 *	- December 27, 2014
 *	- Added advanced functions for string operations
 *	- Now, Gets function will wait till buffer is full or \n is received
 *	- This is prevent for while loop if \n character is not received
 *
 *	With this library, your STM32F4xx will be seen to your computer as Virtual COM Port (VCP).
 *	To be able to work, you have to install ST's VCP Driver, from link below:
 *
 *		http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/PF257938
 *
 *	This library can work in 2 ways.
 *	First and default is Full-Speed mode, second option is High-Speed mode.
 *	Also, different modes have different pinouts.
 *
 *	In default settings, USB FS mode is selected.
 *
 *	STM32F4-Discovery has USB connected to FS mode, but
 *	STM32F429-Discovery has connected it to USB HS in FS mode.
 *	But if you have cable, like me, USB->4wires, you can connect Data+ and Data- to any pin on Discovery board.
 *	I did this, to check, if both mdoes work on bots discovery boards and yes, it worked.
 *	For security reasons set 22Ohm resistors in serial to your data pins.
 *
 * USB FS MODE (micro USB connected on STM32F4 Discovery board)
 *	- This is default option and don't need any special settings.
 *
 *	- Pinout
 *
 *		USB			STM32F4xx
 *		Data +		PA12
 *		Data -		PA11
 *
 * USB HS in FS mode (micro USB connected on STM32F429 Discovery board)
 *
 *	If you are working with STM32F429 Discovery board, and you want to use microUSB connector for VCP,
 *	then set define below in your defines.h file
 *
 *	//Activate USB HS in FS mode
 *	#define USE_USB_OTG_HS
 *
 *	- Pinout
 *
 *		USB			STM32F4xx
 *		Data +		PB15
 *		Data -		PB14
